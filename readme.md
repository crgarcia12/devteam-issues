# World Flags App

This is a simple application that allows users to view all flags from around the world. By clicking on a flag, the application displays the country name and population linked to that flag.

## Features

1. **Flag Display**: The application features a comprehensive list of all country flags from around the world. The flags are displayed in a grid for easy browsing.

2. **Country Information**: When a user clicks on a flag, the application retrieves and displays information about that country. This includes the country's name and population.

3. **Search Functionality**: The app includes a search bar to locate flags quickly. Users can input the name of a country and the app will directly display the corresponding flag.

4. **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and can be viewed on any device, maintaining its functionality and usability whether it's on a desktop or mobile platform.

## Architecture

The World Flags App is structured as follows:

```
/world-flags-app
|-- /src
|   |-- /components
|   |   |-- FlagGrid.js
|   |   |-- FlagCard.js
|   |   |-- SearchBar.js
|   |-- /services
|   |   |-- apiService.js
|   |-- App.js
|-- package.json
|-- README.md
```

- **/components**: This folder contains the React components that make up the user interface. The `FlagGrid.js` component is the main component that displays the grid of flags. Each flag in the grid is a `FlagCard.js` component, and clicking on these will display the country's name and population. The `SearchBar.js` component provides a flag search function.

- **/services**: This folder contains `apiService.js` which handles fetching the country data from a RESTful API.

- **App.js**: This is the main application file that ties all the components together.
